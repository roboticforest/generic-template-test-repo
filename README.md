# generic-template-test-repo

I'd like to take my website repo and make it generic (no branding or content), and then make it public, then finally make a private fork of it which contains the site specific logos, artwork, and content.

The important part: I want the fork to maintain a link to the generic website template it is built from instead of being an independent copy. That way, if the template changes, or if the specialized site makes an improvement, those changes can be reflected in the other repo.

I think this is possible through using project forks, however GitHub doesn't support making forks of your own repos (currently), and I need the fork of the public template to be private. Let's get this figured out.
